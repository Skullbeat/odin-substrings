# odin-substrings
 Project: Sub Strings | Ruby Course | The Odin Project

 > Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. 
 > It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.
